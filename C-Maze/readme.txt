A maze file should look something like this:

10 10 
##########
  # # ## #
# # #    #
#   # ####
# #   #   
# ### # ##
# # # #  #
# # # ## #
#   #    #
##########

# means wall, space means gap.

Give the file on the command line to see the solution.

Give the argument RANDOM on the command line to see a random maze and have it solved.

Give the argument SDL on the command line to see the solution in SDL.
